  abstract = {The ROMIO implementation of the MPI-IO standard provides a
  portable infrastructure for use on top of a variety of underlying storage
  targets. These targets vary widely   in their capabilities, and in some cases
  additional effort is needed within ROMIO to support all MPI-IO semantics. Two
  aspects of the interface that can be problematic  to implement are MPI-IO
  atomic mode and the shared file pointer access routines. Atomic mode requires
  enforcing strict consistency semantics, and   shared file pointer routines
  require communication and coordination in order to atomically update a shared
  resource. For some file systems, native locks may be used to implement these
  features, but not all file systems have lock support. In this work, we
  describe algorithms for implementing efficient mutex locks using MPI-1 and
  the one-sided capabilities from MPI-2. We then show how these algorithms may
  be used   to implement both MPI-IO atomic mode and shared file pointer
  methods for ROMIO without requiring any features from the underlying file
  system. We show that these  algorithms can outperform traditional file system
  lock approaches. Because of the portable nature of these algorithms, they are
  likely useful in a variety of  situations where distributed locking or
  coordination is needed in the MPI-2 environment.  },
