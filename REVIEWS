Dear Jeff,

We are pleased to inform you that your paper "To INT_MAX ... and beyond!" has been accepted for presentation at the
ExaMPI14 workshop at SC14, to be held on November 17 2014 in New Orleans, LA.

I will soon contact you for the preparation of the final version of the manuscript for the workshop
proceedings and I will also provide you the agenda of the workshop.

I am attaching the reviews of your manuscript to this email. Hopefully, they can help you in preparing the
final version of the paper.

Thank you very much for your submission and congratulations.

Stefano Markidis

Well written, interesting and very much on-topic paper.

Figure 2 is not referred to in the text [FIXED]

Reference to "Figures III-B and III-B" should be to "Figures 3 and 4". [FIXED]

----------- REVIEW -----------
The paper presents issues regarding to the support for large-count in MPI, identifies limitations of the current MPI-3 and proposes solutions implemented in BigMPI. Despite MPI provides means to large-count support via MPI derived data-types, applications that don't use MPI derived data type and in need of large count support would benefit by having a simple way to communicate large-count messages. The paper not only proposes a more natural/easier way of using large count messages with BigMPI but it also highlights issues in MPI-3 that need to be addressed for supporting large-count.

The paper is very interesting and most of all is perfectly suited to the exascale MPI workshop. I believe that the results from BigMPI on CrayXC30 and IB clusters would be a very nice addition to the paper, but the paper in the current state is already complete. It would be nice to have references to applications that needs large-count support in MPI.

Overall it is an interesting paper very well suited to the workshop. For these reasons, I recommend the paper for publication.

Only few typos:

- growing core counts per CPU mean -> means [Hm... will let Gail resolve that one]
- only a count of only -> remove one "only" [FIXED]
- straightforward to block -> maybe "break" instead of "block"? [FIXED]
- Figures III-B and III-B  -> Figures 3 and 4 ; I haven't seen citation to Figure 2 but maybe it is there [FIXED]
