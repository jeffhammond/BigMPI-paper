\begin{abstract}
To describe a structured region of memory, the routines in the MPI standard use
a (count, datatype) pair.  The C specification for this convention uses an
{\texttt int} type.  Since C {\texttt int} types are nearly always 32 bits
large and signed,
counting more than $2^31$ 2 billion elements poses a challenge.
Instead of changing the existing MPI routines, and all consumers of those
routines, the MPI Forum asserts users can build up large datatypes from smaller
types.  BigMPI demonstrates a way to perform such a construction, reveals
shortcomings of the MPI standard, and uncovers bugs in MPI implementations.
