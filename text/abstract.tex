To describe a structured region of memory, the routines in the MPI standard use
a (count, datatype) pair.  The C specification for this convention uses an
{\texttt int} type, making descriptions of more than 2 GiB of data difficult.
Instead of changing the existing MPI routines, and all consumers of those
routines, the MPI Forum asserts users can build up large datatypes from smaller
types.  BigMPI demonstrates a way to perform such a construction, reveals
shortcomings of the MPI standard, and uncovers bugs in MPI implementations.
