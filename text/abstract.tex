\begin{abstract}
In order to describe a structured region of memory, the routines in the MPI standard use
a (count, datatype) pair.  The C specification for this convention uses an
\texttt{int} type for the count.  Since C \texttt{int} types are nearly always 32 bits
large and signed,
counting more than $2^{31}$ elements poses a challenge.
Instead of changing the existing MPI routines, and all consumers of those
routines, the MPI Forum asserts that users can build up large datatypes from smaller types.  
To evaluate this hypothesis and to provide a user-friendly solution to the large-count
issue, we have developed BigMPI, a library on top of MPI that maps
large-count MPI-like functions to MPI-3 standard features.
BigMPI demonstrates a way to perform such a construction, reveals
shortcomings of the MPI standard, and uncovers bugs in MPI implementations.
