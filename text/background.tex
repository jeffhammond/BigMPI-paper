\section{Background}

The MPI Forum resolved the large-count issue by deciding the standard already
had sufficient routines to support large-count workloads, and left the matter
of presentation to a vaguely specified additional library.  We took up this
challenge, writing a prototype implementation of
essentially all of the communication functionality in MPI-3.  Our interface
differs from standard MPI only in promoting the ``count'' of the (count,
datatype) pair to the larger MPI\_Count type.  The software implementation is
found in the open-source BigMPI
library and is relatively friendly to users, i.e.\ it has both a Cmake
and an Autotools build system and requires a generic programming
environment composed of a C99 compiler and an implementation
of MPI-3.
