\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

The MPI Forum issued a challenge to consumers of MPI: ``prove to us derived
datatypes are insufficient''.  In a time where 64 bit systems are widespread,
but C integer types remain 32 bits, describing large memory or file requests
will more frequently require the special handling BigMPI provides.  The
exercise has also revealed several difficulties in the standard, particularly
in the area of user-defined reductions.

\subsection{Suggestions for MPI-4}

% (1) 34+338 (+339?) required for sane reductions.
Tickets 34~\cite{ticket34} and 338~\cite{ticket338}
% https://svn.mpi-forum.org/trac/mpi-forum-web/ticket/338
would allow BigMPI (and other users such as PETSc) to leverage ``accumulate-style
behavior'':  the built-in operations can work on user-defined
datatypes, but on a element-wise basis.

Ticket 339~\cite{ticket339} % https://svn.mpi-forum.org/trac/mpi-forum-web/ticket/339
(``User-defined op with derived datatypes yields space-inefficient reduce'')

% (2) 423 is sugar but it greatly reduces user pain and is trivial to implement.
Ticket 423~\cite{ticket423} % https://svn.mpi-forum.org/trac/mpi-forum-web/ticket/423
(``add MPI\_Type\_contiguous\_x'') is syntactic sugar, but it will go a long way towards reducing users' friction when dealing with large counts.  As is evidenced by BigMPI, the change is straightforward to implement.

%430 is required to support nonblocking v-collectives in a straightforward way.
Ticket 430~\cite{ticket430} % https://svn.mpi-forum.org/trac/mpi-forum-web/ticket/430
(``large-count v-collectives'')

%MPICH-style generalized requests required (https://svn.mpi-forum.org/trac/mpi-forum-web/wiki/Proposal should be ticket-ized)
Ticket 457~\cite{ticket457} % https://svn.mpi-forum.org/trac/mpi-forum-web/ticket/457
(``expose progress in generalized requests'')
