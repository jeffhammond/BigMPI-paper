\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

The MPI Forum issued a challenge to consumers of MPI: ``prove to us derived
datatypes are insufficient''.  In a time where 64 bit systems are widespread,
but C integer types remain 32 bits, describing large memory or file requests
will more frequently require the special handling BigMPI provides.  The
exercise has also revealed several difficulties in the standard, particularly
in the area of user-defined reductions.
