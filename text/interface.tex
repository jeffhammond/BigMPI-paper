\subsection{Interface}

The BigMPI API follows the pattern of \texttt{MPI\_Type\_size(\_x)}: 
all BigMPI functions are identical to their corresponding MPI ones except that
they end with \texttt{\_x} to indicate that the count arguments have the type
\texttt{MPI\_Count} instead of \texttt{int}.
Following the MPICH convention, BigMPI functions use the 
MPIX namespace because they are not in the MPI standard.
It is a trivial matter of preprocessing to support arbitrary namespacing
in the library to make it more friendly to other implementers that
may wish to support it as an extension in their library.

%Our interface differs from standard MPI only in promoting the ``count'' 
%of the (count, datatype) pair to the larger MPI\_Count type.

BigMPI has both a Cmake and an Autotools build system for compatibility
with third-party tools that wish to configure BigMPI automatically.
A generic programming environment composed of a C99 compiler 
and ``count-safe'' (i.e. one that supports large-count usage) 
implementation of MPI-3 is required by BigMPI.
