\subsection{Suggestions for users}

% jeff: i don't know what you had in mind here...
Our foremost suggestion to users would be to participate in the MPI Forum.  The
MPI Forum is faced with the difficult task of defining a standard that can be
both used and implemented.  Ideally, one would like to be able to say ``easily
used'' and ``easily implemented'', though tradeoffs are sometimes required.
Participation in the MPI Forum, currently dominated by implementors, can
provide a voice to those whose perspectives are less well heard.

Our second suggestion to users is actually a request: please help provide more
test cases.  Coverage of large count workloads remains sparse.  The sizes we
think of as ``unimaginably large'' today will simply be ``large'' tomorrow.
